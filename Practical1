Theory of dhcp server:
 1)DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is a network management protocol used to dynamically assign an Internet Protocol (IP) address to any device, or node, on a network so they can communicate using IP. 
2) DHCP automates and centrally manages these configurations rather than requiring network administrators to manually assign IP addresses to all network devices. DHCP can be implemented on small local networks, as well as large enterprise networks.
3)DHCP will assign new IP addresses in each location when devices are moved from place to place, which means network administrators do not have to manually configure each device with a valid IP address or reconfigure the device with a new IP address if it moves to a new location on the network. 
4)Versions of DHCP are available for use in IP version 4 (IPv4) and IP version 6 (IPv6).
5)DHCP runs at the application layer of the Transmission Control Protocol/IP (TCP/IP) stack to dynamically assign IP addresses to DHCP clients and to allocate TCP/IP configuration information to DHCP clients. 
This includes subnet mask information, default gateway IP addresses and domain name system (DNS) addresses.


Step 1: Installing DHCP Server in Ubuntu
        $ sudo apt install isc-dhcp-server
        
Step 2: Configuring DHCP Server in Ubuntu
        $ sudo vi /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf 
        
Step 3: Configure Static IP on DHCP Client Machine
        host centos-node {
	 hardware ethernet 00:f0:m4:6y:89:0g;
	 fixed-address 192.168.10.105;
 }

host fedora-node {
	 hardware ethernet 00:4g:8h:13:8h:3a;
	 fixed-address 192.168.10.106;
 }
 
 Step 4: Configuring DHCP Client Machines
         $ sudo vi /etc/network/interfaces
